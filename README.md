### Computers have always fascinated me since I was a kid. Playing video games all day, using social media as a teen, and becoming passionate about software development have all influenced my love of coding. There are so many people from different backgrounds who are able to connect through this one common interest, whether it is solving complex problems or finding a natural ability to design. As a result, I decided to study computer science. My bachelor's degree in computer science was followed by a coding boot camp called App Academy. With all the knowledge acquired from all my teachings, I am eager to contribute to your company with a depth of software engineering knowledge.

### Through App Academy's six-month intensive boot camp, I developed communication skills, gained flexibility with different frameworks, and gained confidence in my abilities as a software developer. I have learned Java, JavaScript, and Python. I have built several projects as well as a Spotify clone which uses a Python backend and a React/Redux frontend and a PostgreSQL database. Most recently I have worked with a company called FDM Group. I have been attending their training, which focuses on Java, Angular and frameworks like Spring and Spring Boot. During this time, I worked with other developers on a ticking system that allows employees to report issues with various problems. This includes payroll and other employee issues.
